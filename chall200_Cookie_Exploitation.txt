This one is really easy but it highlights the importance of enviorment variables.
Were given a website with 3 logins, two of them we have password and usernmes for and only one we just have the admin user
The Goal is to exploit the Cookie generation within the website,  and create a fake cookie of ourselves as admin in order to Authorize ourself with new perms
We can see if we look at the source code of the server, cookies are generated by an HMAC Sha256 Hash of their Session ID which is
shown to be the base64 version of their username and the serverSercret which we found in plaintext. All we had to do was write the cookie generating
alogrythm on our own machines, use the secretKey we found in the db file, and generate a fake cookie authorized as the admin user.
The final cookie is in the format of our hmac Signature and our sessionID (the base64 code of our username)
in the form of sessionID.Signature

Then all we do from their is simply edit our browser cookie for the admins and were IN, and grab flag.
